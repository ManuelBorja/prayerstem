The education of believers in preparation for a Christian response to some "emergency situation" (such as that of Nineveh) has perhaps been overlooked, because we focus only on the importance of being prepared at all times, just as we do for Prevent theft in our homes. While this daily and ordinary preparation is fundamental to the salvation of every individual, it is also true that Jesus said that we should learn to read the signs of the times and that we should "be prepared." Finally, the Scriptures show us the great Mercy and Love of God, which goes beyond His justice. It shows us that God hears and pleases the righteous and those who repent and cry out for mercy
